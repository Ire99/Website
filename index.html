            <p>Till now, he designed more than 1,000 structures. Wright was a key figure in many 20th-century
                architectural movements, teaching thousands of apprentices in his Taliesin Fellowship and influencing
                architects worldwide. He believed in designing for humanity and the environment, and he called his
                philosophy organic architecture. Fallingwater (1935), deemed the best American architectural work of all
                time by critics, demonstrates this philosophy.</p>

            <p>Wright-designed interior elements (including leaded glass windows, floors, furniture and even tableware)
                were integrated into these structures.</p>

        <div class="info-3">
            <p>Wrightâ€™s own texts are a testament to the fact that his ability to articulate himself matched his genius
                with brick, concrete and glass. His books offer readers an exclusive glimpse into the life and work of
                the complex architect. </p>
